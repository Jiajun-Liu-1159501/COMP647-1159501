Financial fraud represents one of the most significant challenges facing modern banking and payment processing systems. With the rapid digitization of financial services and the increasing volume of online transactions, fraudulent activities have become more sophisticated and harder to detect using traditional rule-based systems.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive analytical framework for identifying fraudulent transactions within financial datasets. By machine learning algorithms, we aim to build detection models that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent financial activities.
